Summary for Table 1: Important Questions
The overall deductible for in-network services is $1,500 for individuals and $3,000 for families. You must pay all costs up to the deductible amount before the plan begins to pay. Each family member must meet their own deductible until the family deductible is met. Some services are covered before meeting the deductible, including copayments, certain prescription drugs, and services listed as "No charge." This means that some items and services are covered even if the deductible hasn’t been met. There are no separate deductibles for specific services. The out-of-pocket limit for in-network services is $6,800 for individuals and $13,600 for families. This is the most you will pay in a year for covered services. However, premiums, balance-billed charges, penalties for not obtaining prior authorization, and services not covered by the plan do not count toward the out-of-pocket limit. You will pay less if you use a provider in the plan’s network. Network providers cost less, while out-of-network providers may charge more, and you might receive a balance bill. You can see a specialist without a referral.
