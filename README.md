(info from Page Page 559 â€” 526 - from p2025.txt)

DB Return: 526
GPT Reutn: " Project 2025 states that the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) move west saved $3.5 million in 2022, projected to increase to $10.3 million the following year, which could be used for wildfire risk reduction, recreational opportunities, and conservation efforts. However, it criticizes the Biden Administration for returning senior employees to Washington, D.C., arguing that effective management and responsiveness have been lost as key leaders are no longer close to the field operations in the West, thereby undermining the benefits of the original move."
