Summary for Table 1: Important Questions
Overall Deductible:

In-network: $1,500 Individual / $3,000 Family.
Why this Matters: You must pay all costs up to the deductible amount before the plan begins to pay. Each family member must meet their own deductible until the family deductible is met.
Services Covered Before Deductible:

Yes: Copayments, certain prescription drugs, and services listed as "No charge" are covered before meeting the deductible.
Why this Matters: Some items and services are covered even if the deductible hasn’t been met.
Other Deductibles for Specific Services:

No: There are no separate deductibles for specific services.
Out-of-Pocket Limit:

In-network: $6,800 Individual / $13,600 Family.
Why this Matters: This is the most you will pay in a year for covered services.
Not Included in Out-of-Pocket Limit:

Premiums, balance-billed charges, penalties for not obtaining prior authorization, and services not covered by the plan.
Why this Matters: These expenses don’t count toward the out-of-pocket limit.
Pay Less with Network Providers:

Yes: You will pay less if you use a provider in the plan’s network.
Why this Matters: Network providers cost less. Out-of-network providers may charge more, and you might receive a balance bill.
Need a Referral to See a Specialist:

No: You can see a specialist without a referral.
